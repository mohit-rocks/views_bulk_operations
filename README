# Port of VBO to Drupal 8

A 'light' version of views bulk operations was implemented with views in core. This aims to provide the missing functionality:

- Bulk operations applying configurable actions
- Select all items on this and on all pages.
- Batch processing

This is work in progress.

This is not ready for production.
